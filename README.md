# OSM Completionist

OSM Completionist is an iOS companion app that allows [OpenStreetMap][1]
contributors to complete missing information for objects around them.

Instead of advanced editing possibilities, OSM Completionist uses the concept
of "quests", analog to [StreetComplete for Android][4].

## Based on GoMap

This repository is a fork of [GoMap!!][2], a comprehensive OpenStreetMap editor
for iPhone/iPad.

If you're looking for **a full OpenStreetMap editor**,
[download GoMap on the App Store][3].

# Development

## Auto-generated MapRoulette API client

The API client that is used for communication with the MapRoulette API
is auto-generated using [Swagger Codegen][13]. Make sure to use at least 3.0.18,
since that is the version to introduce (experimental) support for Swift 5.

Install it via [Homebrew][14]:

    % brew install swagger-codegen@3.0.18

In the MapRoulette directory (`src/iOS/MapRoulette`), run the following command
to re-generate the APIs:

    % swagger-codegen generate -i swagger.json -l swift5 -o auto-generated

### Compiling Swagger Codegen (optional)

At the time of writing, the formula for 3.0.18 was not available yet.
Here's how to compile the `swagger-codegen` yourself:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen.git`
2. Change to the folder: `cd swagger-codegen`
3. Checkout the version: `git checkout v3.0.18`
4. Package using Maven: `maven clean package`

# Continuous delivery

OSM Completionist makes use of fastlane.
For a list of available actions, please refer to [the auto-generated README][8].

## Signing

To automate the signing, this project uses [fastlane match][5].
Fetch the certificates for development with

    % bundle exec fastlane match development

## Screenshots

Screenshots are taken automatically with [fastlane snapshot][6].
To create new screenshots, run

    % bundle exec fastlane snapshot

## App Icon

The app icon is based on the 1024x1024 PNG file in `fastlane/metadata/app_icon.png`.
After changing this "master" app icon,
re-generate the app icons using the
[fastlane plugin "appicon"][7] like so:

    % bundle exec fastlane regenerate_app_icon

## Source code structure

* iOS - Code specific to the iOS app
* Mac - Code specific to the Mac app (old, doesn't build anymore)
* Shared - Shared code (drawing code, OSM data structures, etc)
* Images - Images used for application elements (buttons, etc)
* png/poi/Maki/iD SVG POI - Icons used for map elements (POIs, etc)
* presets - The presets database copied from the iD editor

## Assets

The icons for the quests were retrieved from
[rugk/streetcomplete-quest-svgs][10] and then converted to PDF using
[CairoSVG][11]:

    % cairosvg $path -o $pdf_path

For details on the license of the icons, please refer to [authors.txt][12]
in the StreetComplete repository.
